We have improved the quality of conversations and evaluations with the new [GTP-4o model](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/). The new model is more accurate and provides better responses to user queries. We have also improved our prompts so that the evaluation results and suggestions are more relevant and helpful.
