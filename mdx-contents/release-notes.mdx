We are excited to share that we have decided to make Taboo AI **open source and free** for everyone! We believe that everyone should have access to a fun and engaging platform to learn and practice English. And we want to focus on continuously improving the app and making it more fun and engaging. We hope that by making Taboo AI open source, we can **collaborate with the community** to make the app better together. You can find the source code of Taboo AI on [GitHub](https://github.com/xmliszt/taboo-ai).
