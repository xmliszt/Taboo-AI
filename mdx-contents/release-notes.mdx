# Taboo AI Release Notes

_v3.2.1 on 17 May 2024_

## Game results evaluation now runs on GPT-3.5-Turbo

We've upgraded our AI to use the latest version of [GPT-3.5-Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo), which improved the accuracy and speed of game results evaluation. We hope that this will enhance your game experience and provide better learning opportunities for you! However, as GPT-3.5-Turbo is not the best-in-class model, we seek your kind understanding that sometimes the results might not be as accurate as expected.

As Taboo AI is open source and free to use, we are working to add in capability to Taboo AI to allow you to use your own API keys and better models for game results evaluation. Stay tuned for more updates!
