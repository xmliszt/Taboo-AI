## Weekly topics drop!

We have added a new feature to the app - **weekly topics drop**! Every week, we will drop a new set of topics for you to explore. These topics are **curated** in a particular theme, so you can learn more about a specific topic each week. We will also feature any **publicly contributed topics** in the current week from other passionate users like you!

## Feedback dialog

We have added a **feedback dialog** to the app. This dialog will appear after a while when you are at the topics selection page, AI mode page, profile page, or topic contribution page. **We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement**. If you have any feedback, please let us know :)

## Revamped gameplay experience

We have carefully designed and updated the **main gamplay experience** to make it cleaner, more intuitive. The target word is now more visible and much bigger compared to the old version. Picking the target word out from the bottom drawer makes the main conversation pane **more spacious and less cluttered**. We hope you enjoy the new gameplay experience!

## New loading screen

We also designed and added a **new loading screen** to the app. We want to achieve the same neon-light effect that our **AI generated topic** mode has. The new loading screen is more **visually appealing and engaging**. We hope you like it :)

## Hall of Fame

Previously, you might not notice this mode where each topic has a competitive ranking to display the top scorer of that topic. We have re-designed the mode such that it is more fun and exciting to cater to the competitive side of you. We changed the name to **Hall of Fame** and make each card simpler and more visually appealing! Try to toggle the **Hall of Fame** mode in our [public topics page](/levels) and enjoy some confetti and the sense of achievements!

## Less intrusive PWA installation prompt

We have made the PWA installation prompt pop up at the corner of the screen instead of having a fullscreen overlay. This is to make the prompt **less intrusive and more user-friendly**. Oh if you are prompted to install the PWA, do give it a try! More instructions on how to install Taboo AI on your device can be found [here](/pwa).
