We have added a new feature to the app - **weekly topics drop**! Every week, we will drop a new set of topics for you to explore. These topics are **curated** in a particular theme, so you can learn more about a specific topic each week. We will also feature any **publicly contributed topics** in the current week from other passionate users like you!

## Feedback dialog

We have added a **feedback dialog** to the app. This dialog will appear after a while when you are at the topics selection page, AI mode page, profile page, or topic contribution page. **We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement**. If you have any feedback, please let us know :)

## Less intrusive PWA installation prompt

We have made the PWA installation prompt pop up at the corner of the screen instead of having a fullscreen overlay. This is to make the prompt **less intrusive and more user-friendly**. Oh if you are prompted to install the PWA, do give it a try! More instructions on how to install Taboo AI on your device can be found [here](/pwa).
