# Contribute

Taboo AI is an open-source project. To contribute, simply fork the project into your own repository. Look at the [**Issues**](https://github.com/xmliszt/taboo-ai/issues) to find the one that you are interested in working with. Or raise your own issues. Once you are done, simply submit a pull request for review.

## Branching

Taboo AI has `main` branch for production, `preview` for staging. When you create a feature branch, you can either PR to `main` or `preview` depending on the urgency of the issue.

- PR to `main` will be blocked if no approval or unit test or preview deployment failed.
- PR to `preview` requires approval as well.

When you create a PR, GitHub pipeline is automatically run to deploy a staging build to vercel preview. Once succeeded, you can check the deployment from https://taboo-ai-xmliszt.vercel.app .

## Local Dev Environment

When you clone the project, simply run `npm i && npm run dev` to start your development. You might notice certain features in the local dev version not working, for example Google Authentication, Supabase Connection. This is because you need to specify a environment file for local development and it stays in your local and never pushed to GitHub. You should create your own environment file in order for some features to work:

`.env.local`

For any missing values in the environment sample above, if you need it, please feel free to leave me a message and I will assist you in setting up.

## Why not use Vercel env?

Yes the most convenient way is to use Vercel. However, unfortunately I'm on FREE plan in vercel so I cannot add team members in order to do so. So for now, you have to create your own local env file ðŸ˜… sorry for the inconvenience!
