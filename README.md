## Pre-requisites

`Taboo.AI` needs `OpenAI` to work! Therefore, you need to obtain an **API Key** at https://openai.com/api/

Assume you have gotten your API Key: `123456` (just an example),
Go to the root of the project, create a file `.env.local` and put your key inside as follows:

```bash
OPENAI_API=123456
```

Then you are set!
