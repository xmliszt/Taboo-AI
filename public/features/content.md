We are excited to share that the **Profile Page** is finally open for our _signed in user_! For now, you will be able to
change your nickname, revisit past results and your game statistics. You can also delete your account in the profile
page. So [check it out](/profile)!

**Profile Page** can be easily accessed from the side menu or top-right corner of the app, once you have signed in.

If you go to the **Topics Page** ([Choose a topic](/levels)), you will find a new toggle switch on top that allows you
to toggle between the normal level view, or our **new ranking view**. In ranking mode, each topic will showcase the *
*Best Score** and the **Top Scorer**. However, take note that only logged-in user's result can be ranked.
