# **Taboo.AI Updates V2.1!**

## More comprehensive scoring system

We are excited to announce that we have made significant changes to the **scoring system**, making the game even more **challenging** and **rewarding** than before.

In the past, players were scored **solely on their speed** in passing each stage. However, we realised that this did not take into account the **quality of the clues** provided by the player. That's why we have updated our scoring system to give players credit for **both speed and creativity**.


Now, when playing Taboo.AI, players will be assessed based on the **informativeness**, **creativity**, and **knowledge scope** of the clues they provide. Additionally, the AI will penalise players if they **attempt to cheat** by giving inadequate clues. This new scoring system ensures that players will be rewarded for their **overall performance**, rather than just their speed.


Moreover, we have added a new **weighting system** based on the **difficulty level**. The harder the difficulty, the more weight the clue quality will carry in the final score. This means that players will need to think harder about the clues they provide and improve their knowledge to achieve a high score.

*The detailed formula of score calculation is shown below:*

It can also be found in the **Result** page:

So why not give the new and improved Taboo.AI a try today and experience the excitement and challenge of our updated scoring system? With these changes, we are confident that our players will find the game more fun and fair than ever before.

## Better view for result on mobile

On mobile device, the result page now **folds** all the sub-result for each stage by default. You can **unfold** it simply by tapping on the sub-result section. You can also **fold it back** so that your entire result does not get too long. With each combination, you can use the **share** button to take a screenshot of the result page and show off to your friends and family!

## Timer alert

Based on the new **scoring system** implemented, your time score portion is **inversely linearly related** to the time take for you to complete the stage. As seen from the explanation diagram above, your time score is (100) minus the time taken in seconds. Therefore, if you spend more than 100 seconds, you will not get any point from the time portion. The timer will warn you when it is past 50 seconds, and will become red when it is past 100 seconds.
