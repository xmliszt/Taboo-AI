# **Brand New Features!**

## Daily Challenge & Wall of Fame (Leaderboard)!

![Wall of Fame](/features/feature-img-1.png)

Taboo.AI now has an exiting **Wall of Fame (Leaderboard)** for you to compete against other players around the world! Every day there will be a **new daily challenge** Taboo Word Set for you to try. For the fairness of the game, every player will have the same words to play with in the same challenge. Players are then ranked based on their final scores.

![How to access](/features/feature-img-2.png)

To access the daily challenge, simply go to the [home page](https://taboo-ai.vercel.app) and click on **"Daily Challenge"** button. To access the Wall of Fame (Leaderboard), simply click on **"Daily Wall of Fame"** button.

## Nickname Creation / Recovery Key

With the **Wall of Fame (Leaderboard)**, you can now submit your game scores to join the rankings. To do so, you will have to **create a nickname** for yourself that is unique, so that we can identify you. At the start, you will not have a nickname, but not to worry! Simply play one round of the **Daily Challenge** and we will prompt you to create a nickname to save your game scores.

After completing the **Daily Challenge**, we will prompt you to create the nickname and join the leaderboard once we detect that you have not registered with us. By clicking **YES**, you will be directly to the nickname creation page.

After creating the nickname successfully, we will generate this important **Recovery Key** that will only be availble to you. **Recovery Key** is used to restore your games on other devices, or in situtations where you have cleared your browser caches or re-installed your browser. We use this **Recovery Key** to uniquely identify you and retrieve your game scores for you. Hence, keep this **Recovery Key** somewhere that only you know :)

![Submit Scores to Leaderboard](/features/feature-img-6.png)

Afterwards, you will be able to choose to submit your **Daily Challenge** scores to the **Wall of Fame (Leaderboard)** or not. If you do so, you will be able to see your scores ranked among other players who have submitted theirs. It is perfectly fine if you don't want to rank yourself in the leaderboard!

## Recover Your Scores / Playing on a new device?

Since there is no login mechanism in the game (because we don't want to make things unnecessarily complicated but just want you to have fun!), **Recovery Key** that you got when you created your nickname with us, will be the **only way** for you to restore your scores.

![How To Recover?](/features/feature-img-7.png)

To access the recovery, simply click on the **"Recover your scores?** link on the top section of the home page.

![Enter recovery key to recover](/features/feature-img-8.png)

You will be prompted with the **Recovery Key**. Simply input the correct **Recovery Key** and click "Submit" and your session will be restored!
