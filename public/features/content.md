Upon visiting the **Topics page** ([Choose a topic](/levels)), you'll discover a new toggle switch at the top. This switch enables you to alternate between the standard level view and our **new ranking view**. In the ranking mode, each topic displays the **highest score** and the **top scorer**. Please note that only the results of logged-in users can be ranked.
