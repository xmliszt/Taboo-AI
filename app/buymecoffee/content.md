**Dear Taboo.AI community,**

I hope you're all enjoying playing the game as much as I've enjoyed creating it. It has been an amazing journey so far, and I'm incredibly grateful for all the positive feedback I've received from you.

As a solo web developer, creating and maintaining Taboo.AI takes a lot of time, effort, and resources. While I've been doing my best to keep the game updated and fun for all of you, I could use a little help to keep things going.

That's why I've set up a **Buy Me A Coffee** page for those who would like to support me and the game. This is completely optional, but any contribution you can make would go a long way towards ensuring that I can continue to provide you with new updates and features.

Thank you so much for your support, and for being a part of the Taboo.AI community. Your kindness and generosity mean the world to me, and I'm honored to have you as players.

Made with ❤️ by Li Yuxuan
