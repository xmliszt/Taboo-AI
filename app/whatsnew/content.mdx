## Feedback dialog

We have added a feedback dialog to the app. This dialog will appear after a while when you are at the topics selection page, AI mode page, profile page, or topic contribution page. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any feedback, please let us know :)

## Less intrusive PWA installation prompt

We have made the PWA installation prompt pop up at the corner of the screen instead of having a fullscreen overlay. This is to make the prompt less intrusive and more user-friendly. Oh if you are prompted to install the PWA, do give it a try! More instructions on how to install Taboo AI on your device can be found [here](/pwa).
