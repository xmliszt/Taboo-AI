# Upcoming Features

## Major Release V2

> Target End of March 2023

- The **most recent 5 games** of yours can be **saved**! Once you **sign up an account** with Taboo.AI, you will be able to save your scores and **review** them whenever you like!
- **Ranking system**. With scores saved, you can now participate into a **global rank for each category/topic of the words** to see how well you perform. There will be an **individual ranking** among your own past scores (for each category/topic) for you to **beat your own high score**, and also a **global ranking** for each category/topic for you to **compete with others** around the world!
- _(Applicable only to registered players)_ To protect your privacy and give you more control over your records, you can choose to **keep your scores viewable only to yourself**, or **upload them to the global ranking system** to compete with others. Since the score will be publicly available once it is on the global ranking board, you will be given options to **show/hide** your prompts (the input you gave to the AI).
